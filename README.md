# tp_dm_shortcode
Provides a very basic shortcode that outputs a string with "desktop" or "mobile" depending on visitors device. Just use [tp-mobile-desktop] and have fun :)

This was created as a way to output these values in forms that are created with content generators.

# Installation

Simply copy the tp_dm_shortcode.php into your Wordpress plugins folder and activate the plugin.
